Wordpress plugin to follow security recommendations.

Implementing security features for Wordpress what I found on the web. Main sources are:
- Smashing Magazine
- Perishable Press
- Google Search :-)

The purpose of this plugin is to implement basic security tweaks in one plugin to minimize number of plugins enabled on my WP sites.
